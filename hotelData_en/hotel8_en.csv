However, because the year is old, the interior may be disappointed.I was surprised to know that the year was an old hotel.If you do that, it is thought that the management has been good.It was good for all employees who were deployed in many places.The opening of the outdoor swimming pool was said to be from July, so I used indoor swimming pools and saunas.Guests are discounted but not free.I liked the sauna very much.
I had a boat and the weather was good.I was more concerned about the child.I think I should meet a good guest.
It is a good place to go to cool down for a while in everyday life.Even if you don't go out of the hotel, the scenery or internal facilities are good for rest.

There's a little bit of a year and there's no chair or desk on the terrace, so it's a bit vague to enjoy hocs.
Those who use it seemed to be mainly middle -aged couples and group travelers.
The staff are very friendly and the garden is nicely decorated, but I don't think it's going to come back.

However, like the Oriental Hotel in Jeju, Seogwipo Kal Hotel is still showing off the field.At the entrance on the first floor, we are proud of the purple 5 -star board.

Clean, high -floor rooms, such as cute shellfish soaps, soaps are friendly, professional hotel rear, concierge, and delicious breakfast.It was graceful and elegant to keep my memories from fading.
