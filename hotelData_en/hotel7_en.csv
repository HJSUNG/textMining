10.0,"I visited Jeju for about 4 days every month, but I only stay in the hotel.I used it many times, but I often found it in the previous Poonglim.
I think the big advantage of this resort is location.It's located in the middle of Seogwipo, so I think it's a very good location for Jeju Island.E -Mart is also close to it.The resort is not noisy and you can take a walk.
I was glad that I contacted you a little different from the room you booked.It seemed to be partial remodeling neatly, so I enjoyed two nights with my family comfortably.Bedding was also good.
The downside is that the TV is not in the living room and the family is in the room, but the family was a bit uncomfortable, but I traveled to the TV.I would like to eat a school trip separately.
Kensington Resort has played a big role in making a good memory for a long time on a family trip.

The garden view was pretty, but the Mountain View was so cool in the room.
All of their parents in their 60s were satisfied, so they didn't go elsewhere and stayed in the hostel.It's hard to move around with children, but I wanted to be better if I had a pretty garden in the resort and the sea view and Olle trail.
In the accommodation, it was best to have a body view in the Halla Mountain View Garden.
And the staff are really kind. I remembered the faces of the guests.I didn't take a good hotel like that, but I was very careful.

Seogwipo tourist attractions were easy to travel because various buses were visited and talked with Jeju residents.
It is important to note that to ride the bus actively shakes your hands when the bus is approaching ^^ ~ (the bus is just passing by) The drivers are tired of tourists from various countries on the bus.Shhh!The traffic system is different from the land, so I hope you will feel the color ~ Thank you Agoda!Thank you so much than I thought.",10.0,0.9414,0

The Cocomong Lounge Ashley Queen's 24 -hour convenience store entertainment room was fully used.

When checking in, the rooms were kindly informed of various structures such as bed rooms, bed rooms, and ondol rooms, and also provided bedding for children sleeping in the living room.

I was Premier Plus/Mountain View, and I liked both clean and clean facilities and palm trees and Hallasan views that can only be found in Jeju Island.Coffee machine microwave coffees are available and dry toileters were easy to use.There is plenty of towels and exchanged when you put it in front of the shoe rack every morning.

 Jeju ale and bottled water Jeju cup ramen were also provided once by default, but they were all delicious. ^^
The pool also had 4 5 people in safety personnel, so it was also good to play with young children.
The resort was avoiding the use of disposable products from convenience stores to facilities inside, so we were practicing to protect the Jeju environment.
On a rainy day, I was able to make a lot of weight around the resort, and the restaurant called Jeju Bear House around the resort was a walking street, and there were many other restaurants that could be delivered.

9.6,"The view was also very good and the staff are very friendly.It was convenient because there was a 24 -hour convenience store on the first basement floor.The location is not a good location.There are not many restaurants around and something is in a remote place?You have to get on a car everywhere.I think it's the best hostel for family travelers with children in summer.It was good in many ways.But I don't know if it's elementary school student on top, but I was a family traveler with at least two children.It was a lot of time, but the family seemed to be a good night.By 10 o'clock, I endured with a good heart, but it real.I was so thumping that I couldn't sleep, so I was going to go up and tried to fight, but I was really angry.Shouldn't adults should dry if they have adults?Adults were noisy together.I hope the family unit will be assigned to one line.Just go up and down, just play soccer or marathon.I went to my parents and my parents said they were thumping.
Anyway, except that, the staff were kind and all the facilities were satisfied.",23.0,0.9818,0
