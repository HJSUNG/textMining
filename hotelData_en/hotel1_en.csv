Since I first checked in, I was grateful for the staff so kindly.The room was much larger than other hotels, and the bathroom was separated so that two people were available at the same time.The breakfast is simple, but when I go to another area for three nights, my youth child is very sorry and asked me to come back next time.",3.0,0.0285,4

In the room, I slept with my mom and my brother in two big beds.It was great that there was a sofa space where families could drink and snack while watching the view of Jeju sea.
My mom and dad liked the scenery so much.
It is located in the center of Jungmun Tourism Complex, so there are many restaurants and many restaurants.It was easy to buy the soil pigs in that difficult aging, and then buy bread at the Franceli bakery next to the counter, and there is a Seven -Eleven convenience store on the first floor.
And the staff are very kind ~
There are no elevators, but there are only two hotel floors (the fifth floor on the 3rd floor), so it's not inconvenient to go up with a carrier.
The luggage of the ages was moved by the staff ~!

There is no elevator, but the third floor is the entrance floor, so if you are assigned to the third floor, you only need to go up two or three stairs.
The breakfast was even higher and the food was delicious.It was completely relaxed when we went, but there are not many tables, so it seems to be crowded in many seasons.
I also bought apple bread sold in a cafe.If you don't buy it, I think it will be sold out soon.

As a resort, there weren't many facilities like a hotel, but we didn't use it well.

Seven -Eleven in the resort is said to be a private place, and when there are not many people, I closed the door and call me if I call it, but I called it a few times.Still, there were other marts around me, so I wasn't very uncomfortable.

However, some towels were provided, so I used a towel after washing and shower, and I felt steamed.I've also been telling you to the front staff.

Also, the sound of the walls was sometimes heard in the upper room next to it.It was okay because it was a low season, but it would be a little noisy in the peak season.

6.8,I choose this resort as I thought it is near to the beach and has swimming pool. But I was wrong. The swimming pool is closed for construction and the beach is so far away (it involves walking down a hill). Hence  there is nothing for us to do. The balcony did not have any chairs for us to sit down. Anyway the resort is so far away from the beach  there is not much sea view. Breakfast buffet is simple and nothing much to boost about. We went out in the morning to see the nearby waterfall and came back to a call to chase us out  said the check out time is 11am  which is too early. End up we can't take a shower before checking out. What a lousy stay. Will not recommend to anyone.,-1.0,-0.9377,5
