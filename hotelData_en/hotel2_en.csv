Near the accommodation: Once in front of the hostel, there is a way to walk along the morning walk.
If you go to the other side, you can have a cafe or a souvenir shop convenience store.This is possible on foot, and along the driveway for about 10 minutes through the village alley, there is a Starbucks or another convenience store.It's all about 10 minutes to walk, so it's worth going to a walk.

Staff: The owner was so good.I started to write down this review and started to write down ? It's so sincere to grill the bread every morning and take care of the coffee ... If you tell me the direction in the morning, I open a thick note to tell you the places to go there.It was exhaust information!There was no regret that I went and stayed for 4 nights, so I was so kind and friendly like a daughter.

From the moment we stepped into our accommodation  we were struck by the pristine cleanliness and inviting atmosphere. The rooms were not only clean but also incredibly comfy  providing a relaxing haven after our days of exploration.

The complete kitchen was a fantastic convenience  allowing us to prepare meals and enjoy family time together.

The amenities provided at Solarseado Pension were top-notch  catering to our every need.

Their recommendations on places of interest to visit were invaluable  helping us make the most of our time in Jeju.

Breakfast served was simple yet delightful. A spread of coffee  juice and toast awaited us each morning  setting a positive tone for the day ahead. It was a thoughtful touch that added to the overall charm of our experience.

Having stayed in four different accommodation places during our visit to Jeju  we can confidently say that Solarseado Pension is the best  hands down!

The best part about our stay  however  was the staff who went above and beyond to help us find a service last-minute to deliver our bags to our next hotel across the island (because our car rental fell through) and who even offered to personally go and order us take-out for dinner when we first arrived as the restaurants were about to close. They were so kind and really made our stay wonderful. 감사?니?? ?무 즐거???간 보냈?니??,16.0,0.9781,6
