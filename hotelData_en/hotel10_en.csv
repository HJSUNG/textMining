0,10.0,"I was worried about what to do for a long holiday season, but I made a reservation with a landing hall with a water park and a amusement park.
I was going to use the water park, so I didn't have to use the pool, so I booked it as a landing hall without a swimming pool.
It was a pity that TV was not smart TV, but I didn't have much time to see TV.
All of the landing officers were very comfortable and well -known, making it a very comfortable trip.From doorman to front housekeeper, I thought how many hotels could work with.Thank you for making good memories ^^"
1,10.0,"This is the fourth place in mythology.
I feel it every time, but the staff are so kind.When I checked in, it was so good to see the children and take care of it and look for any inconveniences."
2,9.6,"When we arrived, a beautiful friendly staff welcomed us in front of the door.It is very clean and there is a shopping store and a restaurant in the building.If I had stayed more day, I would have wanted to get skin care there.

I would like to express a special gratitude to Jacob.He was upgraded to the room and was professional and kind, giving advice and information on how to visit Jeju.

I have no doubt that I will stay here next time I visit Jeju."
3,10.0,"Shinhwa World Facility is clean and the bed is comfortable. There is no theme park water park shopping bowling food in the mythology world.
Shinhwa World Location takes about 40 minutes from the airport and Aewol is about 30 minutes by car.It's so good. It's not too expensive and perfect."
4,10.0,"I lived in Jeju, but I used it for a vacation because it was a word of mouth to the citizens.I inquired a lot to Agoda and Shinhwa World Reservations because I was in a hurry to make a reservation the day before.
And I have been so well that I can enjoy the water park theme park meal shopping in one place."
5,10.0,"I was happy to buy a better room cheaper than the ball home, and it was good to be a plus for traveling with my parents.In particular, the basic service of the hotel was very satisfied and thanked for cooperating with the employees' kindness and inconvenience.If you stop by Jeju again, it is a hotel you want to use.I think it's a better place to do it.I asked for a request because I lacked drinking water.It was a happy Jeju trip."
6,10.0,"First, I was impressed by the staff's kindness to help check -in.In the first visit, the first visit was to explain the advantages and disadvantages and the feeling of assigning it to the customer's needs was grateful for adding a friendly smile.
I was assigned to the sixth floor, but the view to the sea was more than expected.Most of all, the room is well organized, so I have a good time and I can shop.This is a return plan."
7,10.0,"Employees were very kind, come first, greet and explain the location, and have a different kind of kindness than other hotels.There were so many facilities, so I could stay in the hotel and it was good to go to a nearby famous tourist destination."
8,10.0,"Last week, I went on a family trip to Jeju and stayed in Shinhwa World.In addition, the restaurant shopping mall amusement parks were so convenient.When I go to Jeju, I have to go to Shinhwa World Landing Museum.It was a pleasant trip to Jeju."

It was so sad that I couldn't see it late and I couldn't see it all."
10,9.6,"The landing hall accommodation was not included in the water park and the hotel pool.If you are planning to play in the water, you must book it as a myth.

Nevertheless, I got a theme park ticket and ride the ride (surprisingly fun) and ate a delicious meat because I didn't get out of the restaurant.Everything was convenient and good inside.

When you check in, enter the number.

The accommodation was spacious and clean.When I use the accommodation, it is a lot of cleanliness.However, there is a Parisian noise."
11,10.0,"I sent you all with relatives and parents, but you praised the staff so kind and breakfast."
12,10.0,"It is a complex resort that is almost solved inside, and the facilities are clean and the staff are kind and competent.However, it takes more than 1 hour to check the check -in, so it is not recommended in the high season."
13,10.0,"My mother was alone, but the accommodation was so good that I stayed in the hostel.
The breakfast is really good and the fruit is really honey fruit."
14,10.0,"Because of the water park, I decided to have a lodging here, but I had a reservation as a landing hall because I didn't have a mythology seat.If you have a water play, you must book it as a mythology and check -in Hanni Amusement Park.
Evening fireworks are not too big, but I think I did everything.
The location is close to the experience hall or Jungmun around."
15,10.0,"The hotel itself is also luxurious and resort format, so there are many things to visit or look around.It's a must -see place."
16,10.0,The clean and pretty facilities and the environment were so good. We used the landing hall and plan to use the Myths Hall Marriott Hotel. The friendly guidance was good.I ate it .... Winter is a good time in the season.
17,10.0,"It was a connecting room, so it was a good structure for the party to pass.The cost of price was also very good for the 4 people's accommodation.Except for this, it was a very good hostel."
18,10.0,I asked for a humidifier or baby guard before using the room.You took good care of it.The room is very clean.It was pleasant.I will use it again next time.
19,10.0,"I was surprised by the size and the room was great.It was a little complicated and the middle between the resort and the hotel, but it wasn't bad.There was a lack of cohes, but it was clean and comfortable."
20,10.0,"Special events are often
Compared to the price, I think room condition and size are fine.
Especially in the summer, I recommend the package combined with the pool.
In fact, the swimming pool is large
There are many things to use in the resort
Employees are also friendly"
21,10.0,It's just a good facility without any inconvenience.It is also good to go to Kono in the hotel.The restaurants in the facility are regrettable.It would be better if it was changed to a more recognized menu or brand
22,10.0,"Additional facilities are the best
Shopping Center Restaurant in Resort
Water Park Cinema Play Garden
There is nothing back and the staff are very friendly
Pleasant and clean"

In Sky On Five Dining while relaxing
Deliciously eaten until evening
I enjoyed traveling
It has a comfortable rest
thank you"
24,10.0,"I heard that it was not a Korean accommodation and I haven't been there ...
I had a chance for one night.Prejudice is broken.
It's so kind and well -being, and it's good enough to go elsewhere to send it with a child.Because it was a family of 4 nights with a sense of Jeju feeling
It was great to stay for a day"
25,10.0,"I couldn't even have a seven -year feast with high school 3 dilam and corona after the SAT
It's a pity to pass it, so three women are funny trips.
The accommodation is so good for a happy trip to Jeju.
My mother liked it very much, boasted to his friends and liked it so much.
It's good to catch the hostel, but thank you for grabbing it.
In many ways, it was a pleasant trip because I could relax in mythology world."
26,10.0,"It was good that there were so many facilities available to use.
It was nice to be able to solve all of the restaurant cafes and the choice.
I stayed for 2 nights, but it was so comfortable"
27,10.0,"It's good because it's a new place.I didn't spend a long time at the hostel, but it was clean and good.There will be all there.If you do it with a deluxe King Room, there is no table/chair in the room.

I was assigned to the first floor because I checked in late, but it was okay because the first floor was not a structure that people looked right.Rather, it was good to open the window in the morning.

But ... The door <> corridor is not really soundproofing.Wherever you go, the entrance is not soundproofing, but the corridor is long.

ah!And when I stayed, it was too noisy to talk so much that several people gathered in another room after 10 pm, but in this case, I called it with a desk and asked me to do it quietly.This was good.

Overall, I was good, so if I go to Jeju again next time, I think I'll go to myths world again."
28,10.0,"There was a lot of fun to see such as amenities and amusement parks in the lodgings, so it was so good that I spent half a day in the hostel.It was great because there were a lot of people, but it was not crowded.
When I checked in, it was a pleasant start with the staff's friendly and delicate service, and all the employees I met were so kind that I had finished the trip to Jeju!"

Especially sleeping well, so I slept well ^^"
30,10.0,"It was a fun and exciting trip between my family because I wanted to go to Jeju Island.I want to go again, and the theme park in Jeju Shinhwa World was so good.
I have a child, so I think it was excellent for choosing accommodation.
There was a lot of things to see, the accommodation was clean, the staff were friendly and the cost was very good."
31,10.0,"It is a very satisfying accommodation.You have upgraded the coffin itself, but you have a good feeling thanks to the friendly staff from the check -in!The room condition was good, the breakfast was good, and it was a satisfying accommodation.It was also possible to use the pool free of charge, and it was also good to visit Shinhwa World, so it seems to be a really good hostel for family visitors.However, the door didn't seem to be automatically locked.This seems to be required."
32,10.0,"It was a resort where you can do everything with great and comfortable facilities.I felt like another city in the talent as a space where I was eating, playing, playing, and shopping."
33,10.0,"I visited 2 times.
The facility itself is excellent for the price.
It's a resort format, but I personally stayed because of attending the society.

The first was a personal trip.

As you know, it is difficult to move without a car rental.Even if there is a resort complex, it is a little difficult to solve in it.

I took a bus this time.

The quality and facilities of the room itself are satisfied."
34,10.0,"We also enjoyed the holidays for checking the theme park in Shinhwa World.Garden Seogwipo -ro Garden Garden Road is just halfway, so the location is also very good."

39,9.2,"It is very perfect for the accommodation selected as a resting time for a tired trip.The facilities were available for unpaid rates and shopping.Most of the children's amusement facilities are a bit unfortunate, but I used the rides for fun."
40,4.8,"If I went to Jeju Island, I wanted to go to Shinhwa World, so I read a lot of reviews.I was so disappointed that it might be an advertising team.
The hotel cleaning status is too high, and the room is small, the floor is small and the old is felt, and the veranda glass has food on all kinds of hand -made Deokjideokji bed seats.
This means that you don't wipe the glass at all when you clean it.I used two rooms and both were in that state.Is this a 5 -star hotel?Is it 5 -star in the lobby?The ride is also called the deadline at 6 o'clock, and I ran over 5 o'clock, but there was no ride.There is no reason to come here."

Even so many people are so many, and they are in elbow, and they have a bad breath when they talk, and why are they open to the hotel?I knew it, but it turned out that I had a lot of people on the floor where I was, and I enjoyed the hoccence while I was able to open the door and fixed it.

I couldn't register the underground parking lot and I parked outdoors.
You can choose the ride with the big 3 pass, but I think kids will like it.You shouldn't expect Lotte World or Everland.

I have no doubt that I will stay here next time I visit Jeju."

254,10.0,"I lived in Jeju, but I used it for a vacation because it was a word of mouth to the citizens.I inquired a lot to Agoda and Shinhwa World Reservations because I was in a hurry to make a reservation the day before.

When you check in, enter the number.

The breakfast is really good and the fruit is really honey fruit."

Evening fireworks are not too big, but I think I did everything.
The location is close to the experience hall or Jungmun around."
265,10.0,"The hotel itself is also luxurious and resort format, so there are many things to visit or look around.It's a must -see place."

I had a chance for one night.Prejudice is broken.

It was great to stay for a day"
275,10.0,"I couldn't even have a seven -year feast with high school 3 dilam and corona after the SAT
It's a pity to pass it, so three women are funny trips.

I stayed for 2 nights, but it was so comfortable"
277,10.0,"It's good because it's a new place.I didn't spend a long time at the hostel, but it was clean and good.There will be all there.If you do it with a deluxe King Room, there is no table/chair in the room.

I was assigned to the first floor because I checked in late, but it was okay because the first floor was not a structure that people looked right.Rather, it was good to open the window in the morning.

But ... The door <> corridor is not really soundproofing.Wherever you go, the entrance is not soundproofing, but the corridor is long.

ah!And when I stayed, it was too noisy to talk so much that several people gathered in another room after 10 pm, but in this case, I called it with a desk and asked me to do it quietly.This was good.

Overall, I was good, so if I go to Jeju again next time, I think I'll go to myths world again."
278,10.0,"There was a lot of fun to see such as amenities and amusement parks in the lodgings, so it was so good that I spent half a day in the hostel.It was great because there were a lot of people, but it was not crowded.

280,10.0,"It was a fun and exciting trip between my family because I wanted to go to Jeju Island.I want to go again, and the theme park in Jeju Shinhwa World was so good.
I have a child, so I think it was excellent for choosing accommodation.
There was a lot of things to see, the accommodation was clean, the staff were friendly and the cost was very good."
281,10.0,"It is a very satisfying accommodation.You have upgraded the coffin itself, but you have a good feeling thanks to the friendly staff from the check -in!The room condition was good, the breakfast was good, and it was a satisfying accommodation.It was also possible to use the pool free of charge, and it was also good to visit Shinhwa World, so it seems to be a really good hostel for family visitors.However, the door didn't seem to be automatically locked.This seems to be required."
282,10.0,"It was a resort where you can do everything with great and comfortable facilities.I felt like another city in the talent as a space where I was eating, playing, playing, and shopping."
283,10.0,"I visited 2 times.
The facility itself is excellent for the price.
It's a resort format, but I personally stayed because of attending the society.

289,9.2,"It is very perfect for the accommodation selected as a resting time for a tired trip.The facilities were available for unpaid rates and shopping.Most of the children's amusement facilities are a bit unfortunate, but I used the rides for fun."
290,4.8,"If I went to Jeju Island, I wanted to go to Shinhwa World, so I read a lot of reviews.I was so disappointed that it might be an advertising team.
The hotel cleaning status is too high, and the room is small, the floor is small and the old is felt, and the veranda glass has food on all kinds of hand -made Deokjideokji bed seats.
This means that you don't wipe the glass at all when you clean it.I used two rooms and both were in that state.Is this a 5 -star hotel?Is it 5 -star in the lobby?The ride is also called the deadline at 6 o'clock, and I ran over 5 o'clock, but there was no ride.There is no reason to come here."
