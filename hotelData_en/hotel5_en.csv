Infinite grass, so you can see the mountain right in front of you
Bali?It felt the same and the water was warm.
The mountain view in the pool was good, but the view of the accommodation was so pretty.It was good with a different feeling in the morning and evening.
It was a little chilly in the evening, but after swimming, I stopped by the jjimjilbang.
I want to visit again later when I was born with my parents.
Breakfast dinner buffet is a bit expensive, but
It was easy to eat.
And there are many people who repair, clean, and manage the hotel early in the morning, on weekdays.
So I felt that the hotel was clean and well managed.
The manager is also kind, and the Desk staff were so kind.
It was a very satisfactory accommodation for two nights and three days."

The accommodation is white, so it feels exotic and good.However, my parents had a hard time because they had to walk quite a bit to use amenities.If you go with your parents, you may want a room that is more convenient to use it than a view.It's hard to walk, so give up breakfast.Because you have Yonsei „Ö†
But my parents liked it.It's a place with nature, so I've been relaxing well ~"
6,10.0,"I had two nights with my wife
All of the staff were so kind
Room condition swimming pool is the best
Kesle -dong was a hotel and went down to the pool!Once the adult pool was divided separately, it was the best to be able to swim in different spaces with young children.
It rained often, but the water was lukewarm, so it wasn't cold and it was good.
The smoking room came out of the lobby and went to the left corner.
It will be used again during the trip to Jeju.
The staff are so kind !!"

I have come to Jeju Island a lot, but it was a hotel that gave me a feeling of overseas.The facilities were so good that it was time to enjoy only in the hostel, and the condition was so good and the staff were so kind.
Next time, I wanted to come with my parents, so I said everything."

I enjoyed a recreation üëç"
11,10.0,"The room inside the room was clean and there was no noise between rooms.It is convenient to enter the Eco Land because there is a channel to enter the eco -land at the hotel.However, if you are assigned to the room outside the batch, you have to walk for a long time in the lobby, and the building structure is similar while the building is similar, so you can get lost or wander."

We packed dinner and ate it, but it was good"
13,10.0,"It was a hotel that I accidentally stayed while watching the Eco -Land Theme Park, but it was the place where I was satisfied with the best.It was a lot of money and the swimming pool was available for free until night."
14,10.0,"You can also ride the shuttle, so you can go to the theme park without renting, but you have to be good enough, and most of all, the pool view was good.It's just a problem because the wall materials are hard.Isn't it going to be overwhelmed by scratching the walls later?I thought it was bloody even if I really passed by.But the accommodation is really wide and there's something inside.There is no franchise in the convenience exhibition, and it is operated with a souvenir shop inside.Everyone was good for the service and a lot of buffet food.The dessert is delicious, so leave a dessert."
15,10.0,"Throughout the lodgings, I only went to eat because I didn't have time to enjoy the night opening of Eco Land and the forest tour pool.Of course, breakfast is good for the price!The location was good and the new construction was clean and the bedding was good.There may be a little longer line from the lobby to the room, so if you have children or your parents, you may want to ask for a nearby room!I think it would be nice to enjoy it with my family!I recommend it :)"

17,10.0,"There was no food or something like this, so I had dinner in Jeju City.I was so satisfied that I planned to play with my child.The pool has a variety of water levels, so it was good to be able to swim by choosing where the child wanted, and the accommodation was wider than I thought ^^ And it was very clean ~ I was satisfied.I decided to go one more time next time ^^ It was a bit difficult to park, but we had dinner and went in the evening and parked at the nearest place.The other cars looked at it all, so I put it on the shoulder."
18,10.0,"I used it by my mother and a four -year -old daughter.
I was so satisfied that I was able to rent a bed guard and stroller for the baby.I was frowned and I had a meal, but the staff had to eat comfortably for a while.
Because I was trying to do a hoced because of my baby, I had a good condition for the accommodation.
The surrounding area was surrounded by forests and lakes, so it was also healed. Nearby Eco Land was good. Unlike other hotels, the floor heating was good."
19,10.0,"If this price is at this price, from now on traveling to Jeju, it is an eco -land pick and a pick.Great site pretty views are good room -in -room fantastic swimming pools.It's not a big buffet, but it's a buffet that I picked up and used it.If you live in Jeju Island, I think it's worth eating.It's perfect for Hokans."

22,10.0,"Neat rooms cool swimming pool friendly staff delicious breakfast
It was a really perfect hotel.
Thanks to the three family trips, we start comfortably.
thank you!"
23,10.0,"Once the price is reasonable and it is in the forest, it is automatically bathed.
The rooms are generally large and the pool is very good.The land of the eco -land is wide, so the walk is good, but the moving line is a little long.There are plenty of parking lots, and employees are generally greeting in the eyeballs.It doesn't change.The sad thing in the pool is a low season, so there are few people, but it can be used because it can be used for the sunbed and used.The pool employees seem to need CS education, which is eye -catching and greeting like a room employee."

29,9.6,"I found it by chance, but it was so clean and pretty and I felt like I came abroad.
The price was so good compared to the room, and it was a satisfactory stay.
I had to walk the pool outside, but it's a little cold at night, so I haven't been to the pool.
The breakfast is delicious and the restaurant view is good
The staff are all kind !!
It's a hotel I want to visit again, and I uploaded a picture."
30,9.6,"It was a good accommodation without falling out
I had both dinner and breakfast, but there are many foods that my child can eat
It was fun to eat without worry.
It's ambiguous to be a convenience store, but it's small and pretty, so you can buy it there.
Please note that this will not be inconvenient if you come or buy before or buy it before the accommodation.

What are you talking about?
The room was so good and I did it well, but I cleaned it well.
Instead, there was a little dry

The pool was not diverse, but I played well
If you are looking for a place where you want to rest rather than activity, the eco hotel will be customized !!"
31,9.2,"After eating dinner at Jeju restaurant, I checked in late, so I was assigned to the end of the building.
It is good to contact the room near the pool during check -in.The streets are not stopped for using children and swimming pool bakery stalls or lobbies.
The pool is thumb!
The hotel view from the warm water and the pool is very good with the feeling of coming abroad.
The stall in the pool is a bit price.
There is a shower dehydrator in the dressing room in the swimming pool, so it is recommended to swim after hitting the swimsuit in the dressing room rather than going to wear a white gone in the room.In the summer, other seasons are so cold even if they wear a gown in wet swimsuit.Sampu, body cleanser dehydrator and dry towel are placed in the shower.
If you stay here at the hotel, the eco -radial ticket was half price discount.
Swimming and Eco -Land tourism are recommended.
The staff are kind and the facilities are fine.
The room is clean but it doesn't feel 5 -star.
I hope you swim ..
I want to go again next time."
32,10.0,"I went when it was cold, but the pool water was so warm and the circled photo was not going to go to the child.

I want to go again"

35,10.0,"Clean, beautiful, spacious and kind.
The pool was also good, but the day we went was in the cold, I only took pictures in the pool and was in Onsu -tang.Personal sloppers are required when you go to the swimming pool.It is slippery and freezing when moving.It was nice to have a shower and dry in the outdoor dressing room.
I used it because I was good at dinner, but it is recommended.Especially the sashimi is delicious.

The smell of the rock was so bad.And the shower facility was also good.I had a very comfortable and good time, but the biggest disadvantage is ..!The location is a little far from the road.It takes more than 5 minutes even if you drive from the road to the hotel.I was so satisfied except for this point."

Compared to other places, the pool is spacious and the beach towel is free of charge.
It's a very good quality hotel without a clumsy.
The staff are good and kind ~
However, at the dawn of the last night, our room lighting system broke down and the entire room began to blink.
Eventually, I wrapped up my luggage to another room at 2 am, but it didn't seem to have been delivered when I checked out the next day.
I was sleeping at night, and on the last day, I was going to get a claim for a claim.
I only heard a word that I was sorry when I was taken over. I wouldn't have come out like this.

212,6.0,"It's a big hotel because it's a big regret because you can't enjoy 100 % in winter.It seems more like that because you can't use 100 % of a wide and cool swimming pool.I took a five -year -old child, had an additional cost of hotel, and used a hotel dinner buffet.In the case of 36 months or older, it is the same amount for the age of 12, so the amount is more expensive than the number of foods that can be eaten.If you subdivide the price or have more food for kids, it will help you to increase your home tourists.In the detail page, the cost of the number of people under 12 years of age is listed at 2,000 won, which seems to be necessary.In the season other than summer, I recommended it because I wanted to visit it in the summer or in the summer.ps.The view of the Super's Twin Room (upgrade) was a road view.You can see the road coming to Ecorland.I had to walk for 5 minutes to the lobby, and I heard that the same rooms close to the lobby are not recommended because they are the cheapest rooms for building wall views.However, because almost all facilities are on the lobby, family travelers will give up the view and assign a room close to the lobby."

226,8.0,"I used the warm swimming pool well and played well and sleeped well ~ The lake was so pretty and good and the room was good !!

At the same time, the road that snowed a lot was a little blocked and I had to be nervous because of my eyes.However, employees were able to enter safely because they were good at snowfalls or guidance.
The reason I chose this place was that unlike other hotels, the landscaping was located in a beautiful forest, a room and a spa in the pool.

It was good for the lodging to come and feel Jeju. The pool was wide enough and deep.
It was really annoying to spit that only the uncles could do it in the pool, wearing ordinary clothes.
Anyway, the second thing to talk about like that
It is clear that the hotel is a very good hotel from the customer's point of view.What I felt while using it was not empty words

Above all, the staff are so kind
The buffet of dinner was a little price
Still, I am satisfied because it is so good in terms of taste and quality.
The staff were so kind to thank you.
Recommended for those who enjoy hocs
However, if you are trying to go to a tourist destination, I think it was a little difficult to move the path in the middle of geography.
But next time I will go again to enjoy it."
316,9.6,"Once you enter the hotel, it's hard to come out.The advantage is that the facilities and restaurants are so good that you don't have to come out, and it's time to go to the mountain road.However, the staff were friendly and the accommodation was good enough to surpass this shortcoming.I plan to come back to Jeju Island next spring or summer, and I will stay at the Eco Land Hotel."

I used it for 3 nights and it's a shame today.
The staff are very kind.
Thank you for your help when you request it.
If you are cleaning, please be kind.

My family didn't like the buffet, so I used only breakfast breakfast.
It was finished with one or two plates, but that's because of our camouflage.

I used it in the hotel, but it is fresh and delicious seafood.
Defensive Dome Beef Cypress Steamed Set Set Set Bride and Seafood, even though it doesn't like seafood, it is delicious.
The karaoke room was also clean, so I used it comfortably with Lee.
Free swimming pool for guests!The water quality was clean and warm so I used it pleasantly.

The front staff allocated the room close to all the facilities on the first floor of Castle -dong, so it was close to the swimming pool and it was easy to go to every convenience store.
And another .. It's close to the bakery, so I'm asleep in the morning with the smell of baking.
I felt so good about this ~~
I like the smell of bread !!!!!Bakery is delicious here !!

I haven't used the lodging in Jeju Island and I have never written a review, but it's a hotel that made it possible to stay comfortable and enjoyable during the raining Jeju 3 nights.

But in winter, the room was so hot that it might have risen to 20 degrees.It was too hot to open the window.I would rather turn on the air conditioner in summer, but it was hotter because only the heater came out ..."

However, it is a bit uncomfortable because it has to be externally when using the pool."
334,4.8,"There is an Infinity grass, but there is no reason to go out of the grass with a desolate mountain view.The location is ambiguous, so it's inconvenient to go out and it's difficult.Even the convenience store is very uncomfortable because it has to go for more than 5 minutes.There is a souvenir shop to buy simple things in the facility, but there are no types of things early and there are many types of things.I asked if there was something for emergency medicine at night, but the staff didn't have any digestive agents, so I went to the convenience store.The resort was big and the copper line was inefficient, so I had to walk a lot inside.I don't seem to go again.Rather, mythology was better."
335,10.0,"It was a little unfortunate because of the inland side
 As you enjoy the scenery around you from the entrance, the family feels satisfied and relaxes comfortably.The viewing of the gallery in the basement of the hotel is also impressive, and the hotel market is also very cute.When I saw the swimming pool, I regretted that I didn't prepare for a swimsuit, and at the same time, I wanted to use all the convenience facilities of the hotel.It was uncomfortable because it was not set if it was forbidden to use the knife for breakfast.It was too hot in winter because the room temperature was not smooth.It will be promised to come back in the summer, and then use the eco -land package at that time."

The room was basic satisfaction haha"

344,8.8,"It's relatively new, so it's clean
The price is also cheap, but the location is a bit too bad!
And it's a twin room, so the room is smaller than I thought."
345,9.2,"The feeling of the appearance image is in the European village
Perfect as a transition course.
The Infinity Pool was also so fun to play in the winter.I stayed a day, but I felt tired!"
346,9.2,exorcism
347,9.2,"Due to the nature of Jeju Island, there are many roads without streetlights when the sun goes over, so I checked in late time.But it was also quiet and good to walk in the morning.
The breakfast was also delicious, so I ate enough to burst, and it was the best because it was both noodles and Korean soup.
The staff were friendly and floor heating, and it was warm and at the end of October.
However, it is not a convenience store, but there is a store that sells convenience goods, and there is nothing around, so I thought it would be nice to be late even if it was operated unmanned."
348,8.8,The Eco Land Theme Park was also good and the pool for children to use was impressive. Thank you for taking care of the gown.
349,9.6,Too warm and comfortable hotels are clean and good
350,7.6,"Location Îä® It's far from the busy street, but it's good.The breakfast is a bit expensive and there are few guests on the rain?I think there are many stores inside, there are many empty spaces and fewer employees.However, there are only two swimming pools to be satisfied with the price."
351,9.6,"The rooms are clean and have been able to use various facilities such as hot water pools and breakfast buffets at low prices.

One thing that's unfortunate is that people who don't stay in Eco Land don't know if they use hotel facilities, but there were employees who asked if they were guests.But 'Are you not staying here?'I didn't feel good because I asked in a doubt and way of saying.The rest of the staff were all kind and good."
352,10.0,"I was in a remote place in Jocheon -eup and I was worried about the poor weather, but it was fun enough to relax through the swimming pool or internal facilities.I used all the buffet meals, but the food was not so diverse, but the quality of each food was high, of course."
353,7.6,have to find a meal inside the hotel site. but not many options. convenience store is definitely needed to open there. in-house shop is just rip-off!!
354,7.6,I think it's clean and the air is good.
355,8.4,"It has been a long time since I traveled to Jeju Island with my mother.
 It blends with the beautiful nature to enjoy it in a nice and clean resort -shaped hotel.

 Twenty years ago, when I swimmed at Lotte World Swimming Pool in high school with my mom, I swimmed outdoors at night for the first time.

The hotel breakfast was fine and I recommended Eco Land.
 
There were a lot of complimentary reviews about bedding, and it was really soft, duck hair blanket, and I was surprised at the generous investment when I saw the mattress and bed Simmons.

The floor is also tiled, so I slept warmly because it was clean and ondol floor ^^
It was clear and clean without the bathroom and the shower booth.

If there was a regret that did not fit the 5 -star hotel, the male manager of the unkind and manner -free expression and tone of the restaurant.
If you are more concerned about the service education of the staff, it will be a great and perfect healing hotel while staying."
356,8.4,It was all good except location.
357,8.0,"I traveled alone.
The hotel is pretty and good"

359,10.0,"Especially winter super recommended
The pool is so cold that you can swim like a hot spring water in the cold weather.
The accommodation is also very clean
Anyway, because of the swimming pool, just go up here
If Jeju tourism is the purpose, cheap breakfast will be a business hotel, but if the purpose is to resort, it is recommended here."
360,7.2,"The hotel is low and wide, so it's far from the lobby to walk from the lobby, and it's far from the gym or swimming pool in the room."
361,10.0,"First of all, the room condition is very good.
Infiniti pools are a bit narrow, but they're good.If you are the purpose of using the pool, ask you to assign it to your nearest room.It was hard to take a 10 -minute walk to the swimming pool."
362,10.0,You can use four seasons and the scenery in a pretty building that looks like a fairy tale.It was the best life accommodation.

Still good"
368,9.6,"I had to go into the middle of the middle, but the Hamdeok was close and the location was better than I thought.The bed was so comfortable that I could sleep without breaking.I thought it would be nice to use the family couple."
369,7.6,"Room condition is so good and all good
It's a canteen and bakery ... It's a bit expensive ...
The way to the swimming pool is too far ... „Ö†„Ö† ... „Öã„Öã
The location was also ambiguous, so it was hard to go out to eat."
370,7.6,"I went to early September and the accommodation was pretty and I liked the pool so much that I had two nights here.
He gave me a map, but for a day, I was looking for a room-front-restaurant for a day.
The food was as expensive and the pool was so pretty ~
I slept in the Lake View Room, but the view was so good.
I really want to go back.
However, the map is large enough to have a map, and when I left it, I learned the way ... I asked for ice in the evening, and the first day was late, so the restaurant was over, and when I came to the front, I understand and get to know.
The next day, I went to swimming, and I didn't buy dinner, so I ordered a chicken sold in the hotel and said I had to come to the restaurant.
I washed it while my friend was going to go, called the front and asked for ice.
But I'll talk to the restaurant, so I told you to go to the restaurant.I asked if I could bring it, and I told you about 3,000 won for room service.
The restaurant is the first basement floor and we have to turn around the two -thirds of the two -story wheel to change the elevator.
At first, it was amazing and fun, but it was bothersome to go on the first floor with Elbeta with tired body.
It took me how long it took and it took 10 minutes.
Then my friend brought a chicken, but I thought my friend was also ice.
So I told you to the restaurant and told me to talk to the front.
I don't know what the system it is, but ...
I asked for the ice. Say the front of the front of the restaurant. If you don't want to go to the restaurant, go to the restaurant.
To get out, I had to take a car and go out for at least 20 minutes and solve everything inside.
If you look at the quality of the hotel, it's obvious that you really want to go, but if you think about each small service, you can think that there is no service cost for hotel and only hotel quality and view (natural landscape).
If you want services and amenities, I would like to recommend Grand Hyatt."

372,10.0,It was a trip that was satisfied with both the Qinggu. I want to come again.
373,9.2,Neat and good

We were in a good place to swim in winter, but it was great.

Because it is located in Zhongshan
The nearby restaurant was close to at 7 o'clock, and I had to feel the inconvenience of having to go to Hamdeok to eat something.

Especially, families with young children think that they would like to visit when they travel."
395,8.8,"The floor was not a carpet but a tree, so it was good to be heated like ondol.The room was not narrow and big and it was good to rest.However, the kindness of the facilities and the front employees is unfortunate ..."

There is not enough hotel convenience store"
408,8.0,"First of all, I liked the scenery around the hotel and I also liked bedding and room condition.
I chose only the pool, but the outdoor pool was so pretty and wide that I was satisfied with leaving or swimming with photos.
The downside is that the location is too far from the city, so there's nothing nearby, and even the shop in the hotel is open late and eat.There is not a lot of floors, so the distance to move to the facilities is quite far, especially when I go back to the swimming pool, I was uncomfortable to go to a long distance, so I showered in the dressing room.It seemed to be hard
I only saw the pool and I didn't apply for breakfast, but I was very satisfied with the price."
409,5.6,"I don't understand that there is no toothpaste toothbrush razor.Humidifier rental.Far out of the airport and breakfast is less priced.

427,7.2,"The swimming pool is the best „Ö†
There is a long way to come to the room

And because there is nothing around
I was frustrated

But if you want to feel nature, I think it's good."
428,7.6,"The comfort of nature was so good.
When I checked in, all the staff were kind and the airport shuttle was so good.There is no convenience store in the hotel and there is a simple store.It smells like mold in the elevator.It was nice to have a large cypress bath in the room and the four seasons outdoor hot water.Hotel guest restaurant Eco Land discount is good."

436,10.0,"Natural landscape, swimming pool, pocha, etc.
There were a lot of places to get closer."
437,8.8,"It's a pity that there's quite a way to the swimming pool
The charm of the accommodation surrounded by nature is very large.
The advantage is that it is clean because it is a hotel that has a lot to see and has not been built for a long time."

448,9.2,"I stayed with three and three
It was good to be late for the pool

A accommodation like a fairy tale
Very pretty accommodation
As an assigned room aa
No ... why are you so pretty?

The room was spacious and comfortable.
Bedding is also soft, so honey sleep
Expected swimming pool is also very satisfied
It was too bad to have a short trip.
Next time I'm going to come longer.
But the unfortunate thing is that there is nothing except the forest around.
There are no various foods."
453,9.6,"A nice appearance
Inside the unique room
Satisfied as a whole
I stayed at Wall Suite, but the bed size would be a bit more cut (not double, Queen or King)
It would be nice if there was a detailed guide map of the hotel
I stay comfortably

   When using the Eco Land Theme Park, it is discounted and connected immediately.

465,8.8,The best
466,4.8,"The pool and nature are really good.The accommodation stayed on the first floor of Lake View, but every morning, the tourists passed by and took pictures right in front of the hostel.It doesn't include breakfast in this price.In the next room, the baby wakes up at 7 am and tells what he says to screaming.If you go around from the entrance, the location is ambiguous, so you don't want to take a rest in your accommodation.I give you two fingers as well as two fingers."

It seems like it won't go without summer
There is no place to eat around the hotel, so it is inconvenient because it has to go 30 minutes."
470,9.2,"The Eco Land Hotel was a very good hotel for price.
The environment inside the hotel felt like I was in Europe, the swimming pool was good (although it was a bit cold), especially the surrounding eco -land walk.After checking out, we finished the trip to the mountains, nature and wind at a stone culture park nearby."

472,7.6,"Price price!
I tied up cheaply at other lodgings and swimmed here, but it was just the right place.
It was not a convenience store, but it was only a snack bar, but it was very expensive and there was nothing to eat.
All this was all good
Outdoor pools are also romantic and enjoyed well
Next time, I want to buy Masit and visit!"
473,10.0,The pool was so good
474,9.6,"It was good to be able to enjoy the day without going out of the hotel.An emergency medicine is a convenience store?It sells at it, but the price is expensive and there are not many types.(30 minutes to the city) The evening menu was very satisfactory"

482,10.0,Ako Land is also good. It was better using the hotel.
483,9.6,"It was so good to think about room condition and bedding.It's soft, so I slept. But there was a noise between floors?
So I liked the pool too much."

487,6.8,"Believing Eco Land !!
It was so good this time.
However, it was a bit unfortunate to have employees and services.
Breakfast is also breaking in the kitchen.

I hope it will be improved.
Good job ^^"

490,9.6,Good Good Good
491,8.0,"I went without expectation and went to the Jungmun hotel every time and went to Eco -Land as a cost -effectiveness.It is recommended if the hardware is not the latest style, but if you want to relax without the need for tourism because it has a wide ground with a European hotel feeling.
However, it seemed to be a little insufficient to use the swimming pool facilities.
It was a pity that the Sunbed paid or the Towel US -made"
492,6.4,"Once you can't connect to the front of the room.I don't know if I'm not deliberately turned to the line, but I've never been connected for two nights and three days, so I went down to the lobby every time.
And even if you pay the cost, there is no additional bedding service.
Oh, and there is only one microwave all over the hotel.

In addition, the employees, including the housekeepers, are very friendly, clean and well -being, good kids room and satisfaction"
493,9.6,"Eco Land Hotel has an outdoor swimming pool more than other resorts or hotels in Korea.Adult pools and children's pools are significant
Also, it is so good to walk with Eco Land
However, the bread & coffee digging on the first floor of the basement will be served at 10 am at the cafe at 9 o'clock.It's a 5 -star hotel cafe, so I thought it was called ""10 o'clock.""Early the early morning cold bread came out at 10 o'clock and was disappointed."
494,8.4,"It's surrounded by the mountains, so you don't need to say good air ~ ^^ It's easy not to go out of the hotel after entering the hotel.Appropriate size swimming pool.Steamed delicious restaurant.Up to Ecorand next door! ^^ There are many things you can enjoy cheaply after leaving.Hotel fitness is very shining."
495,7.6,"The only advantage was one swimming pool.
It is natural in this class hotel, such as hygiene & employee attitudes.

disadvantage.
The location is so ambiguous.At least 40 minutes of round trips are basic to go out to eat or get to the city.

I wanted to play in Eco Land after leaving, but it's expensive to solve the meal at the hotel, and it's annoying to come back to eat.

Of course, the location is in the corner, but there are some nature -friendly
When I am a lover, I don't think I will visit again
If you have a child, I will visit again."
496,8.8,"I was able to sleep comfortably with room condition and mattresses.Breakfast buffet is also delicious, so it is better to include.It was the biggest advantage of Ecorand's walking on the child and hotel.However, the hotel location is too remote to go to eat.If you didn't move, it was a pity that there was no restaurant for lunch or dinner in the hotel.But this price was the best enough to come back."
497,8.8,"I felt the Mediterranean and I liked it that my husband chose well
Room condition
It was all good"
498,8.4,"In commemoration of your parents' birthday, you were satisfied with the good lodging of the two."

If you are lucky, you will be right if you are lucky, but you have to wait a few minutes if the weather is not good or the timing"
