10.0,"This is the second visit.If you open the window, you can see Seongsan Ilchulbong and sit and see the sunrise.The staff were kind and the pool was operated in November, so I thought of a property.Of course, it was a pity that the water was cold and the weather was cold.If the day is good (the wind regards), even if you don't swim, it's a good idea to have a barbecue.The bed is so cozy and good.I bought a beer, but I couldn't eat and fell asleep and it was very refreshing.I opened it to know where the brand bed was, but I failed to know ^^ It was hot in front of the road.I must talk about water pressure, and the shower water pressure was the best in Jeju travel.I praise the mosquito patch on my body.I will visit again next time.really!!!The breakfast is really good, so be sure to eat it.It costs 12,000 won to 16,000 won per meal, so be sure to eat at the hotel in the morning.Very strong and good composition.The restaurant is viewed by Seongsan Ilchulbong Peak.Wow, I liked it so much ...",31.0,0.9916
