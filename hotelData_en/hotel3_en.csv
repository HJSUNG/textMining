It's a couple white room, so it's perfect for couples to travel !!I think it's okay to stay if there are additional bedding.While we were living, there was a typhoon news, so the waves were high and there were many cloudy days.I'm definitely come back!"

However, there was a regret.
In addition, there was a part that I was worried about not visible from the outside because the bed curtains were blind.
The other part was so satisfied that it was good!"
